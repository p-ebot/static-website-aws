## Deploy Static Website on AWS

### In this project, I deployed a static website on AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

#### The files included are: 

1. `index.html` The Index document for the website.
2. `/img` The background image file for the website.
3.  `/css` CSS files for the website.
4.  `/doc` Folder with the step-by-step file with screenshots created by me.

You can access to the website using this [link](http://d2nap6o49ug3f9.cloudfront.net/index.html)

**NOTE**: The folder `/vendor` it didn't upload because contain the third party files, such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) and [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
